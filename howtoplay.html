      </div>
      <div class="mt-5" id="textBox">
        <p class="font">In this game you need to get as much "fractals" as possible. Fractals are a form of ressource or currency to get new stuff.
                      With fractals you can buy upgrades called generators. The first generator "convolution" produces fractals for you. You dont 
                      have to click anymore because now youre getting fractals automatically. The upgrades below convolution dont produce fractals. 
                      They produce the upgrade above it. So the second upgrade "translation" produces more convolution, which then produces more 
                      fractals. 
        </p>
        <p class="font">While all of this is happening, a fractals gets drawn. For now its just a triangle fractal (a so calles Sierpinski Triangle).
                        Once you get more fractals the drawn fractal will get more and more clearer. This will make you have a better "Quality" whichh determines 
                        the amount of fractals you get per ADD FRACTAL button click. When you click the button the charge bar under it will go empty.
                        The more filled the bar is, the more fractals you will get with the maximum depending on the quality. You can make the chargebar recharge
                        quicker by buying the "interpolation" upgrade.
        </p>
        <p class="font">The goal is to do a fractal shift. This will lead you to the next phase of the game, which is not implemented yet.
